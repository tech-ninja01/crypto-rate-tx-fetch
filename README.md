# Future Enhancements
1. Apply caching strategy for exchange rates prices, which will be updated in regular intervals using background jobs
2. Use pagination while fetching/updating exchange rates for coin market API, as of know I just used limit 200
3. Use background jobs to track transactions status and update in DB
4. Use bearer strategy authentication mechanism using passport
5. Add unit tests, as of know I added integration tests only as we are majorly interacting with third party APIs
